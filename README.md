#Develop an app with Gemini

In this, you use Gemini, an AI-powered collaborator in Google Cloud, to explore, create, modify, test, and deploy a sample app.

This is intended for developers of any experience level who contribute to building apps but might not be familiar with cloud application development. It helps to have some experience using VS Code or Code OSS as your IDE and to be familiar with Python and the Flask framework.

Objectives
In this learn how to perform the following tasks:

Create a cloud-based application development environment by using Cloud Workstations.
Explore various Google services that you can use to deploy an app by asking Gemini context-based questions.
Prompt Gemini to provide templates that you can use to develop a basic app in Cloud Run.
Create, explore, and modify the app by using Gemini to explain and generate the code.
Run and test the app locally, and then deploy it to Google Cloud by using Gemini to generate the steps.


Task 1. Configure your environment and account.

Task 2. Create a Cloud Workstation.

Task 3. Update the Cloud Code extension to enable Gemini.

Task 4. Develop a Python app.

Task 5. Deploy the app to Cloud Run.
